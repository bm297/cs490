Test case result: 120
Result: "public static int factorial(int number){if (number < 2){return 1;}return (number*factorial(number-1));}"

Write a function called exponential that takes an integer input called number and returns the integer to the power of itself using a for loop.
Function name: exponential
Category: forloop
Difficulty: medium
Test case: 5
Test case result: 3125
Result: "public static int exponential(int number) {int total=1;for (int i=0; i<number; i++){total = total*number;}return total;}"

Write a function called parity that takes an integer input called number and returns the string "even" if the integer is even or "odd" if the integer is odd using conditional statements.
Function name: parity
Category: conditional
Difficulty: medium
Test case: 5
Test case result: "odd"
Result: "public static String parity(int number) {if (number%2==0) {return "even";}else {return "odd";}}"

Write a function called doubleNumber that takes an integer input called number, continuously doubles it as long as the new number is less than the result of the original number squared, and returns the number of iterations of the loop.
Function name: doubleNumber
Category: whileloop
Difficulty: hard
Test case: 5
Test case result: 3
Result: "public static int doubleNumber(int number) {int newNumber=number;int count=0;while (newNumber<(number*number)) {newNumber=newNumber*2;count++;}return count;}"

Write a function called finder that takes a string input called text and returns the index which corresponds to the first occurrence of the letter "a". If "a" is not present in the string then the function should return the value 999. 
Function name: finder
Category: indexing
Difficulty: hard
Test case: "test"
Test case result: 999
Result: "public static int finder(String text) {for (int i=0; i<text.length(); i++) {char temp=text.charAt(i);if (temp=='a') {return i;}}return 999;}"

Result: "public static String returnText() {return "Hello World";}"

Write a function called duplication that takes one integer input called number and returns the same number.
Function name: duplication
Category: none
Difficulty: easy
Test case: 5
Test case result: 5
Result: "public static int duplication(int number) {return number;}"
